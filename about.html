<p> I was born in West Palm beach Florida, 1991. As a child, music started very young for me. I started to sing at the age of 3,was in the band during my teenage years,<br>
    The instrument I played was the Trumpet. I was all-district in 2004, and stipp played all the way through High School.<br>
    I  didnt realize how far music was going to go with me, But Now that I have a degree in Audio Production, I feel fully accomplished towards my goals in the Music Indusrty. <br>
    One of my goal is to win a <strong>Grammy</strong> before I'm 30. <br>
    <strong>Music is....</strong> <br>
    <strong>My Passion,,,,,</strong> </p>
